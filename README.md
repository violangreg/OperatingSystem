# OperatingSystem
Operating System labs and projects using c on linux

- Utilized Linux Ubuntu C to learn about low level processors.

- Used PID, fork, exec, resource/memory management, deadlock, blocking and non-blocking, stack, threads, cpu schedulers and virtual memory.

- Created PIDs, parent and child processors that rely on each other for computing resources.

- Developed a deadlock manager, processors wait and resource is held until it is finished.
